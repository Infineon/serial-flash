# Serial Flash

### Overview

Provides functions for interacting with an external flash connected through its Single SPI/Dual SPI/Quad SPI/Octal SPI interface. The flash operations read, write, and erase are implemented as blocking functions. This library accepts the configuration generated using the QSPI Configurator tool but supports only one memory slot. Note that PSoC 6 supports up to 4 memory slots on the same QSPI block. 

### Features

* Accepts the configuration generated by the QSPI Configurator tool
* Supports Execute-in-Place (XIP) mode of operation
* Provides information about the external memory to the programming tool for it to be able to program the memory, for example, when user wants to place the code into the external memory for XIP operation. 

### Quick Start
1. Add \#include "cy_serial_flash_qspi.h"
2. See the [PSoC 6 MCU: QSPI Flash Read and Write](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/mtb-example-psoc6-qspi-readwrite) code example to learn using this library
